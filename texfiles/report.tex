\section{Introduction}

Your introduction goes here! Simply start writing your document and use the
Recompile button to view the updated PDF preview. Examples of commonly used
commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

Once you're familiar with the editor, you can find various project setting in
the Overleaf menu, accessed via the button in the very top left of the editor.
To view tutorials, user guides, and further documentation, please visit our
\href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn}{help library}, or head to our plans page
to \href{https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans}{choose your plan}.



\section{Some examples to get started}

\subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

Simply use the section and subsection commands, as in this example document!
With Overleaf, all the formatting and numbering is handled automatically
according to the template you've chosen. If you're using Rich Text mode, you can
also create new section and subsections via the buttons in the editor toolbar.

\subsection{How to include Figures}

First you have to upload the image file from your computer using the upload link
in the file-tree menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in
your document. Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a
number and a caption to your figure. See the code for Figure~\ref{fig:frog} in
this section for an example.

Note that your figure will automatically be placed in the most appropriate place
for it, given the surrounding text and taking into account other figures or
tables that may be close by. You can find out more about adding images to your
documents in this help article on
\href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Including_images_on_Overleaf}{including
images on Overleaf}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figure/frog.jpg}
\caption{This frog was uploaded via the file-tree menu.}
\label{fig:frog}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to add Tables}

Use the table and tabular environments for basic tables --- see
Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. For more information, please see this help
article on \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/tables}{tables}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lr}
    \toprule
    Item & Quantity \\
    \toprule
    Widgets & 42 \\
    Gadgets & 13 \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{An example table.}
\label{tab:widgets}
\end{table}

\subsection{How to add Comments and Track Changes}

Comments can be added to your project by highlighting some text and clicking
``Add comment'' in the top right of the editor pane. To view existing comments,
click on the Review menu in the toolbar above. To reply to a comment, click on
the Reply button in the lower right corner of the comment. You can close the
Review pane by clicking its name on the toolbar when you're done reviewing for
the time being.

Track changes are available on all our
\href{https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans}{premium plans}, and can
be toggled on or off using the option at the top of the Review pane. Track
changes allow you to keep track of every change made to the document, along with
the person making the change.

\subsection{How to add Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to change the margins and paper size}

Usually the template you're using will have the page margins and paper size set
correctly for that use-case. For example, if you're using a journal article
template provided by the journal publisher, that template will be formatted
according to their requirements. In these cases, it's best not to alter the
margins directly.

If however you're using a more general template, such as this one, and would
like to alter the margins, a common way to do so is via the geometry package.
You can find the geometry package loaded in the preamble at the top of this
example file, and if you'd like to learn more about how to adjust the settings,
please visit this help article on
\href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/page_size_and_margins}{page size and
margins}.

\subsection{How to change the document language and spell check settings}

Overleaf supports many different languages, including multiple different
languages within one document.

To configure the document language, simply edit the option provided to the babel
package in the preamble at the top of this example project. To learn more about
the different options, please visit this help article on
\href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/International_language_support}{international
language support}.

To change the spell check language, simply open the Overleaf menu at the top
left of the editor window, scroll down to the spell check setting, and adjust
accordingly.

\subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

You can simply upload a ``report.bib'' file containing your BibTeX entries,
created with a tool such as JabRef. You can then cite entries from it, like
this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well
as the filename of the ``report.bib''. You can find a
\href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video
tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.

If you have an \href{https://www.overleaf.com/user/subscription/plans}{upgraded
account}, you can also import your Mendeley or Zotero library directly as a
``report.bib'' file, via the upload menu in the file-tree.



\section{How to write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a
sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with
$\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\begin{equation*}
    S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
\end{equation*}
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables
$\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0,
\sigma^2)$.

In this section we provide some examples of commonly used commands and features.

\subsection{Wavefunction} \label{sec:wavefunction}

The wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$ describes the quantum state of a particle. It
satisfies the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:schrodinger}
    \ri\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = 
    -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\Psi.
\end{equation}
The wavefunction must be normalized, meaning the integral of its magnitude
squared over all space is equal to 1:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:normalization}
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\Psi(x,t)|^2 \,\rd x = 1.
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:schrodinger} represents the time-dependent Schrödinger
equation, while Equation \eqref{eq:normalization} ensures the wavefunction's
normalization.

The expectation value of an observable $A$ is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:expectation}
    \langle A \rangle = \int \Psi^*(x,t) \,A\, \Psi(x,t) \,\rd x.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation} \label{sec:timeindependent}

For stationary states, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:timeindependent}
    -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\rd^2 \psi}{\rd x^2} + V(x)\psi = E\psi.
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:timeindependent} describes the energy eigenstates of a
quantum system. The eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator potential $V(x) =
\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ are given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:harmonicoscillator}
    \psi_n(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n n!}} \left(\frac{m\omega}{\pi\hbar}\right)^{1/4} 
    \re^{-\frac{m\omega x^2}{2\hbar}} H_n\left(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}}x\right).
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eq:harmonicoscillator} represents the wavefunctions associated
with the energy eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:example_1} This is a theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:example_2} This is another theorem.
\end{theorem}

Theorems \ref{thm:example_1} and \ref{thm:example_2} can be referred to using
their respective labels throughout the text.
